# Mansplaining the Game

Less of a game and more of a scoreboard for a game ... assemble your mansplainers ... setup the smart contract and deploy it to a local ethereum network ... run the node server ... and if you have an internet button config and hook that up as well.

  - DB Layer handled by smart contract
  - Simple one-pager front-end
  - REST endpoint for internet button control
  - Internet button source code included!
